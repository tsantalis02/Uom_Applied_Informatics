# This code snippet applies length function on height vector and sort 
#                 function on weight vector. 


# It returns the length of height vector(from ex_02.R):
print(length(height)) # 5

# Increasing and decreasing sort of weight vector(from ex_02.R):
print(sort(weight,decreasing=FALSE)) # Increasing sort
print(sort(weight,decreasing=TRUE)) #Decreasing sort
